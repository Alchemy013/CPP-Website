            <h2>Self Care</h2>
          </a>
          <p>
            In today’s fast-paced world, it’s easy to get caught up in daily
            responsibilities and forget to take care of ourselves. However,
            self-care is essential for maintaining our physical, emotional, and
            mental well-being. It’s not just about pampering yourself; it’s
            about creating healthy habits that support a balanced and fulfilling
            life.

          <p>
            Recently picked up reading small articles and got a new perspective
            with regards to Nature from Ryan Paugh - Coach, Speaker and
            Philosopher. Often when people are stressed or going through
            depression , they are advised to connect themselves to Nature by
            having strolls in parks and appreciate the love around. However, its
            not only important for people who are going through any medical
            condition or nature lovers to connect with Nature but its equally
            important for all of us because WE are Nature ! YOU are Nature !

            The only vegetable that brings out any visual emotion in us is "The
            Onion" ! Yes, it makes us cry but that makes it Unique from all its
            fellow companions. Some dislike its strong odor while some think its
            medicinal. The same Onion is being looked at in different ways. We
            as varied personalities have some traits too which might be
            appealing or irking at the same time to people around us. As long as
            we are not harming anyone with our actions, its okay to BE YOU !

            <h2>Metamorphosis of Mind - Turn Negative into Positive</h2>
          </a>
          <p>
            During these uncertain times of COVID 19 crisis, the last thing we
            all want is to be around people who intentionally or unintentionally
            exude Negative vibes. Negativity can be spread through both verbal
            and non verbal communication. In my opinion, the mind is impacted
            more via the non verbal communication rather than the verbal one.
            Instead of changing things or people around you, its YOU who has to
            do some work in filtering out the negative emotions . You need to
            turn around those negative sensations into something positive that
            works for you. And these are just simple things or ways of thinking
            that can trigger a calmer mind.

            <h2>Self Analysis - An Underestimated tool</h2>
          </a>
          <p>
            While talking of mental well being amidst this pandemic, the Therapy
            of Self Analysis plays a crucial role. The key ingredient of this
            therapy is "Self Honesty" which involves the skill of knowing your
            unconscious self. Digging deep inside to understand your own
            personality, your desires and your Story. This also helps one to
            uncover his/her motivations. Top of mind ways of conducting self
            analysis are either by writing it out or talking it out or even
            both.

          <p>
            What ? My first reaction to it was that this must be something again
            philosophical & good to hear stuff. All I know is the varied
            languages that we speak globally or the languages that my computer
            understands such as Java, Angular and what not. To be honest,
            recently, the lock down has been taking a toll on my thought process
            & mood. A very kind soul shared to me a powerful video by Louise L
            Hay in an attempt to make me understand that there is actually a
            Language of Universe.

            <h2>Being Compassionate !</h2>
          </a>
          <p>
            Can Compassion be Learnt or is it Innate ? Is everyone equally
            compassionate in all facets of his/her life? Is it possible people
            may show compassion at work, on social platforms and put up a
            different face in their personal life ? Often these questions come
            up in my mind especially during the Covid times that we are living
            in. Well, the good bit is that research says it definitely can be
            learnt. Compassion for me is more of understanding others problems
            and try to the best of your ability to at least not aggravate their
            problem in any which way.

            Do you know what harnesses your energy ? In today's time where we
            all are multitasking & leading a stressful life in one way or the
            other, it is very important to understand what revitalises us. Half
            of the battle is won if we have the optimism & positive energy
            towards anything we want to accomplish.
